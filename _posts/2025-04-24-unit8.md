## Multilevel Indices Example

```javascript
--Create a database
CREATE DATABASE employee

-- Use database
\c employee

-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    department TEXT,
    salary NUMERIC
);

-- Insert dummy data
INSERT INTO employees (name, department, salary)
VALUES
    ('John Doe', 'Sales', 50000),
    ('Jane Smith', 'Marketing', 60000),
    ('Michael Johnson', 'Engineering', 70000),
    ('Emily Davis', 'Sales', 55000),
    ('David Wilson', 'Marketing', 65000),
    ('Sophia Thompson', 'Engineering', 75000),
    ('Daniel Anderson', 'Sales', 52000),
    ('Olivia Taylor', 'Marketing', 62000),
    ('William Thomas', 'Engineering', 72000),
    ('Emma Martinez', 'Sales', 57000),
    ('Jacob Hernandez', 'Marketing', 67000),
    ('Isabella Garcia', 'Engineering', 77000);

-- Create the inner index on the name column
CREATE INDEX idx_employees_name ON employees (name);

-- Create the outer index on a subset of the inner index
CREATE INDEX idx_employees_name_outer ON employees (name)
WHERE id % 4 = 0; -- Only index every 4th row

-- Query to find employees with name starting with 'J'

SET enable_bitmapscan = on;
SET enable_seqscan = off;

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE name LIKE 'J%';
```
Note: The SET methods will force an index scan, however, this is not recommended as the database should determine by itself whether to use an index or not. For testing purpose we are turning off sequential scan which will get triggered due to the size of the table.

## Secondary Indices example

```javascript
--Create database
CREATE DATABASE stud_ent

--Use database
\c stud_ent

-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE students (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    grade INT,
    city TEXT
);

-- Insert some data
INSERT INTO students (name, grade, city)
VALUES
    ('John Doe', 90, 'New York'),
    ('Jane Smith', 85, 'Boston'),
    ('Michael Johnson', 92, 'Chicago'),
    ('Emily Davis', 88, 'New York'),
    ('David Wilson', 79, 'Los Angeles');

-- Create a secondary index on the grade column
CREATE INDEX idx_students_grade ON students (grade);

-- Query using the secondary index
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM students WHERE grade > 85;
```
In this example:
- We create a table students with columns id (primary key), name, grade, and city.
- We insert some sample data into the table.
- We create a secondary index idx_students_grade on the grade column.
- When we query the table looking for students with a grade greater than 85, PostgreSQL will use the secondary index to quickly find the relevant rows, instead of scanning the entire table.

### Secondary indices can also be created on multiple columns, known as composite indices.

```javascript
-- Create a composite secondary index on grade and city
CREATE INDEX idx_students_grade_city ON students (grade, city);

-- Query using the composite index
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM students WHERE grade > 85 AND city = 'New York';
```
In this case, the composite index on (grade, city) will be used to efficiently find students with a grade greater than 85 and city 'New York'.

#### Note:
Secondary indices improve query performance but come at the cost of additional storage space and overhead for insert/update/delete operations (since the index needs to be maintained). Therefore, secondary indices should be created judiciously, based on the query patterns and performance requirements of your application.
