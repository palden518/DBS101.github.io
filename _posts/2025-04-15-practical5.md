# Guided Session

Example Database: DigiDB

## Create DigimonDB
1. Create DB using pgadmin4 
  - Create DB "digiDB"
  
## Setup PokeDB

2. Create a folder called "DigiData"
3. Download csv files and create tables

    -  DigiDB_digimonlist.csv
    -  DigiDB_movelist.csv
    -  DigiDB_supportlist.csv
    

  - Create tables inside digiDB using the following SQL commands
  ```javascript
            CREATE TABLE digimon (
            number INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            name TEXT,
            stage TEXT,
            type TEXT,
            attribute TEXT,
            memory INTEGER,
            equip_slots INTEGER,
            lv50_hp INTEGER,
            lv50_sp INTEGER,
            lv50_atk INTEGER,
            lv50_def INTEGER,
            lv50_int INTEGER,
            lv50_spd INTEGER
        );

        CREATE TABLE moves (
            name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
            sp_cost INTEGER,
            type TEXT,
            power INTEGER,
            attribute TEXT,
            inheritable TEXT,
            description TEXT
        );

        CREATE TABLE support_skills (
            name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
            description TEXT
        );
  ```
  - Import csv files into tables using pgadmin
    - Import:
      - DigiDB_digimonlist.csv into digimon table
      - DigiDB_movelist.csv into moves table
      -  DigiDB_supportlist.csv into support_skills table
  
     Example Tutorial
     
     - Right-click on the table

     - Choose import/export data

     - Choose the file csv file to import

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/palden518/DBS101.github.io/master/assets/images/pract5_3.png">

     - Check columns to be imported

     - Check options as Header -- Identifies headers from the csv file to add entries/tuples into table

1. Create a view EggDigimon in the database, add the following as code to retrieve only baby digimon
   ```javascript
    SELECT 
        d.name AS digimon_name,
        d.stage,
        d.attribute AS digimon_attribute,
        m.name AS move_name,
        m.sp_cost,
        m.type AS move_type,
        m.power,
        m.attribute AS move_attribute,
        m.description
    FROM digimon d
    JOIN moves m 
        ON m.name LIKE '% I'
    AND d.attribute = m.attribute
    WHERE d.stage = 'Baby';
   ```
2. Create a view FireDigimon in the database, add the following as code to retrieve only fire type digimon and give them moves based on their evolution stage
    ```javascript
        SELECT 
        d.name AS digimon_name,
        d.stage,
        d.attribute AS digimon_attribute,
        m.name AS move_name,
        m.sp_cost,
        m.type AS move_type,
        m.power,
        m.attribute AS move_attribute,
        m.description
    FROM digimon d
    JOIN moves m 
    ON d.attribute = m.attribute
    AND (
        (d.stage = 'In-Training' AND m.name LIKE '% I')
        OR (d.stage = 'Rookie' AND (m.name LIKE '% I' OR m.name LIKE '% II'))
        OR (d.stage IN ('Champion', 'Ultimate', 'Mega') AND m.name LIKE '% III')
    )
    WHERE d.attribute = 'Fire'::text;
  ```
# Practical 5 Exercise

-  Suppose you maintain a Digimon table that inadvertently stores multiple special moves in one column. Consider the following modified table:
digimon_number | digimon_name | stage | special_moves
1 | Agumon | Rookie | Pepper Breath, Spitfire
2 | Gabumon | Rookie | Ice Blast, Horn Attack
3 | Patamon | In-Training | Light Attack, Thunder Shock

- Is there a violation of atomicity in this table? If so explain and implement improvements for the table.


-  Suppose you have a table that stores the moves learned by each Digimon during battles. In this table, the primary key is composite (digimon_number, move_name). Consider the following table:

digimon_number | move_name | move_type | sp_cost
1 | Pepper Breath | Special | 3
1 | Spitfire | Physical | 2
2 | Ice Blast | Special | 4
2 | Horn Attack | Physical | 2

- Explain why the non-key columns (move_type, sp_cost) depend only on part of the composite key (specifically, the move name) rather than on the entire key.
- How would you restructure the schema to eliminate the partial dependency and achieve Second Normal Form?


- Consider a table that records Digimon battles, but it includes a non-key column that is transitively determined by another non-key attribute. Assume the following “DigimonBattle” table:
battle_id | digimon_number | opponent_name | opponent_attribute | recommended_move
101 | 1 | MetalSeadramon | Virus | Data Burst
102 | 2 | Devimon | Dark | Shadow Claw
103 | 3 | Myotismon | Virus | Data Burst

In this design, suppose the recommended move is determined solely by the opponent’s attribute (for example, all battles against a Virus-type opponent have the same recommended move).

- Explain why the recommended_move column is transitively dependent on the non-key column opponent_attribute rather than directly on the primary key (battle_id).
- Why does this design violate 3NF?
- Propose how you would decompose this table (for instance, by creating a separate OpponentStrategy table that pairs opponent_attribute with recommended_move) so that the battle table satisfies Third Normal Form.


- Suppose there is a table used to manage training sessions for Digimon. The table contains details about the trainer, the Digimon, and the training location:
training_id | trainer_name | digimon_number | training_location | trainer_experience
1001 | Tai | 1 | Dojo A | 5 years
1002 | Matt | 2 | Dojo B | 3 years
1003 | Tai | 3 | Dojo A | 5 years

- Which dependency in this table violates the Boyce-Codd Normal Form?
- Why is trainer_name (which determines trainer_experience) not a candidate key?
- Propose how to decompose this table into two (or more) tables to ensure every determinant is a candidate key.
