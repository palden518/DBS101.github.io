# Guided Session

## Task 1:

```javascript
CREATE DATABASE transaction_demo;
```
```javascript
\c transaction_demo
```
```javascript
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    position VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    salary NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL
);
```
### Task 2: Transaction Operations

```javascript
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO employees (name, position, salary) VALUES ('John Doe', 'Software Engineer', 70000);
UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE name = 'John Doe';
DELETE FROM employees WHERE name = 'John Doe';
COMMIT;
```
### Task 3:  Advanced Usage with Savepoints

A SAVEPOINT in transactions is a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back without affecting the preceding operations. Savepoints allow you to partially undo a transaction, making it easier to handle errors or perform complex operations that might require temporary checkpoints within the same transaction.

Key Features of Savepoints

- Nested Transactions: Savepoints provide a way to create nested transactions within a larger transaction.
- Error Handling: They enable more granular control over error handling by allowing rollback to a specific savepoint rather than aborting the entire transaction.
- Complex Operations: Useful in complex operations where intermediate states need to be validated or modified without committing the entire transaction.

```javascript
BEGIN;
SAVEPOINT savepoint1;
INSERT INTO employees (name, position, salary) VALUES ('Tom Brown', 'Data Analyst', 65000);
SAVEPOINT savepoint2;
UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.05 WHERE name = 'Tom Brown';
SELECT * FROM employees;
```
Note: Tom Brown, Data Analyst, 71662.50 is added as an entry to the table

### Task 4: Rollback to first savepoint: 

```javascript
ROLLBACK TO savepoint1;
SELECT * FROM employees;
COMMIT;
SELECT * FROM employees;
```
Note: Tom Brown, Data Analyst, 71662.50 is is removed from table

### Task 5: Understanding Transaction Rollback

```javascript
-- Start a transaction
BEGIN;

-- Insert two employees
INSERT INTO employees (name, position, salary) VALUES 
    ('Michael Chen', 'UI Designer', 72000),
    ('Emma Wilson', 'Database Administrator', 78000);

-- Check the employees
SELECT * FROM employees;

-- Simulate a transaction failure or decision to abort
ROLLBACK;

-- Verify that neither Michael nor Emma were added
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

### Task 6: Handling Errors in Transactions

```javascript
-- Start a transaction
BEGIN;

-- Successfully add an employee
INSERT INTO employees (name, position, salary) VALUES ('James Smith', 'QA Engineer', 69000);

-- Try an operation that will fail (violate NOT NULL constraint)
-- This should cause an error but not automatically roll back the transaction
INSERT INTO employees (name, position, salary) VALUES ('Invalid Employee', NULL, 50000);

-- Check transaction status
-- In PostgreSQL, you can check if you're still in a transaction with \echo :AUTOCOMMIT

-- We need to decide what to do after the error
-- Option 1: Roll back everything
ROLLBACK;

-- Option 2: (In a new transaction) Use savepoints to salvage part of the work
BEGIN;
SAVEPOINT before_error;
INSERT INTO employees (name, position, salary) VALUES ('James Smith', 'QA Engineer', 69000);
SAVEPOINT after_valid_insert;

-- Try the operation that will fail
INSERT INTO employees (name, position, salary) VALUES ('Invalid Employee', NULL, 50000);

-- Roll back just to after the valid insert
ROLLBACK TO after_valid_insert;

-- Complete the transaction with just the valid insert
COMMIT;

-- Verify that James was added but not the invalid employee
SELECT * FROM employees;
```


# Practical Exercise

### Task 1: Design a database to demonstrate bank transactions called BankTransaction, draw the Entity-Relationship diagram and the relational schema of the database. Include appropriate entities/relations and attributes to represent:
- Customer information
- Account details
- Transaction records
- Banking rules (e.g., minimum balance requirements)
### Task 2: Insert dummy data into database for demonstration.
### Task 3: Develop SQL queries to demonstrate each ACID property in your banking system.
    a. Atomicity
    b. Consistency
    c. Isolation
    d. Durability

Hint: To demonstrate atomicity:
- Create a transaction that transfers money between two accounts.
- Implement a transaction that creates a new account and transfers an initial deposit.
- Write a transaction that fails halfway through and demonstrate how atomicity prevents partial execution.
- Write a short paragraph of explanation to describe this scenario.
