## Before we begin the tasks, check if all of the tables inside your Airlineticketingdb have data, if you have deleted them while performing some deletion exercise from the previous practical, go back to practical 2 and run the INSERTION QUERIES for the empty tables.


## Task 1: Aggregate Functions

- ### Average
  Get average flight distance:
  ```javascript
  SELECT AVG(Distance) AS AverageDistance 
  FROM Flight;
  ```
  Get average flight fare by class:
  ```javascript
  SELECT AVG(Fare) AS AverageFare, Class_type  
  FROM Class
  GROUP BY Class_type;
  ```
  Get average flight duration:
  ```javascript
  SELECT AVG(Arr_time - Dep_time) AS AverageDuration  
  FROM Flight;
  ```
- ### Minimum
  Get minimum flight fare across all classes:
  ```javascript
  SELECT MIN(Fare) AS MinimumFare  
  FROM Class;
  ```
  Get shortest flight duration:
  ```javascript
  SELECT MIN(Arr_time - Dep_time) AS MinimumDuration
  FROM Flight;
  ```
- ### Maximum
  Get maximum flight fare across all classes:
  ```javascript
  SELECT MAX(Fare) AS MaximumFare
  FROM Class;
  ```
  Get longest flight duration:
  ```javascript
  SELECT MAX(Arr_time - Dep_time) AS MaximumDuration  
  FROM Flight;
  ```
- ### Count
  Get number of flights:
  ```javascript
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS NumberOfFlights 
  FROM Flight;
  ```
  Count of number of tickets purchased for Business class:
  ```javascript
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS business_class_tickets
  FROM Ticket t JOIN Class c
  ON t.Class_id = c.Class_id
  WHERE c.Class_type = 'Business';
  ```
  Count of passengers paying more than average ticket fare:
  ```javascript
    WITH avg_fare AS (
    SELECT AVG(c.Fare) AS avg_fare
    FROM Class c
    JOIN Ticket t
    ON c.Class_id = t.Class_id
    )
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS passengers_above_avg
    FROM Ticket t JOIN Class c
    ON t.Class_id = c.Class_id,
     avg_fare
    WHERE c.Fare > avg_fare.avg_fare;
   ```
## Task 2: Aggregate with Grouping

Find the average ticket fare for each class type:

```javascript
SELECT c.Class_type, AVG(c.Fare) AS Average_Fare
FROM Class c
GROUP BY c.Class_type;
```
Find the number of flights per airline
```javascript
SELECT a.Airline_name, COUNT(f.Flight_no) AS Number_Of_Flights
FROM Airline a INNER JOIN Flight f
ON a.Flight_no = f.Flight_no
GROUP BY a.Airline_name;
```
Find the number of distinct destinations across all flights:
```javascript
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Destination) AS distinct_destinations
FROM Flight;
```
## Task 3: Having Clause

```javascript
SELECT Source, COUNT(*) AS NumberOfFlights, AVG(Distance) AS AverageDistance 
FROM Flight
GROUP BY Source
HAVING AVG(Distance) > 2000
ORDER BY NumberOfFlights DESC;
```
This query:
1. Groups the flights by their source airport
2. Calculates the number of flights from each source (using COUNT(*))
3. Calculates the average flight distance from each source (using AVG(Distance))
4. Uses HAVING clause to only include groups with average distance greater than 2000 miles
5. Orders the result by descending number of flights
   
## Task 4: Date and Time Manipulation

Extract the year and month from ticket booking date time:

```javascript
SELECT PNR_No, DATE_PART('year', Date_time) AS Booking_Year,
       DATE_PART('month', Date_time) AS Booking_Month
FROM Ticket;
```
Add 5 hours to the arrival time for all flights:
```javascript
SELECT Flight_no, Dep_time, Destination,  
       Arr_time + INTERVAL '5 hours' AS Arr_time_new
FROM Flight;
```
## Task 5: Output Redirection

1. Create a new table with distinct flight numbers:
```javascript
SELECT DISTINCT Flight_no 
INTO Distinct_Flights
FROM Flight;
```
2. Copy data into an existing table structure:
```javascript
INSERT INTO Airline_Backup (Airline_name, Contact_no, Flight_no)
SELECT Airline_name, Contact_no, Flight_no
FROM Airline;
```
3. Create a new summary table with results from aggregation query:
```javascript
SELECT Flight_no, COUNT(*) AS Booking_Count 
INTO Flight_Booking_Summary 
FROM Ticket
GROUP BY Flight_no;
```
4. Insert aggregated results into an existing summary table:
```javascript
INSERT INTO Flight_Summary (Flight_no, Total_Miles, Total_Duration)
SELECT Flight_no, SUM(Distance) AS Total_Miles, 
       SUM(Arr_time - Dep_time) AS Total_Duration
FROM Flight
GROUP BY Flight_no;
```
## Task 6: Output Control

1. Limit
```javascript
SELECT * 
FROM Flight
ORDER BY Distance DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
2. Order By
```javascript
SELECT t.Passenger_name, c.Fare AS Ticket_Fare
FROM Ticket t JOIN Class c
ON t.Class_id = c.Class_id
ORDER BY c.Fare DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
## Task 8: Nested Subqueries

### 1. Set Membership

```javascript
SELECT *
FROM Flight
WHERE Flight_no IN (
  SELECT Flight_no
  FROM Ticket 
  WHERE Passenger_name IN 
    (SELECT Passenger_name 
     FROM Ticket
     WHERE PNR_No = 'PNR123')
);
```
This query:

- Finds all tickets booked by the passenger with PNR 'PNR101' (innermost subquery)
- Gets the passenger name from those
- Finds all tickets booked by that passenger (middle subquery)
- Gets the flight numbers from those tickets
- Finds details of all those flights (outer query)

### 2. Set Comparison

```javascript
SELECT a.*
FROM Airline a
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT * 
  FROM Flight f INNER JOIN Airline a2
  ON a2.Flight_no = f.Flight_no
  WHERE a.Airline_name = a2.Airline_name AND
        f.Distance > ALL (SELECT Distance
                           FROM Flight f2 INNER JOIN Airline a3
                           ON a3.Flight_no = f2.Flight_no
                           WHERE a3.Airline_name = 'Indigo')
);
```
### 3. Test for Empty Relations

```javascript
SELECT a.Airline_name
FROM Airline a
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT *
  FROM Flight f 
  WHERE f.Flight_no = a.Flight_no
);
```
This query:

- Selects all airlines from the Airline table (outer query)
- Use a correlated nested subquery to check if there are any flights for each airline's flight number
- Returns those airlines for which there are no matching flights

### 4. Test for the Absence of Duplicate Tuples
```javascript
SELECT *
FROM Flight
WHERE Flight_no NOT IN (
    SELECT Flight_no
    FROM (
        SELECT Flight_no, COUNT(*) AS num_flights
        FROM Flight
        GROUP BY Flight_no
        HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
    ) AS duplicates
);
```

### 5. Subqueries in the FROM clause

```javascript
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT passenger_name, COUNT(*) AS num_tickets
    FROM Ticket
    GROUP BY passenger_name
) AS ticket_counts
WHERE num_tickets > 1;
```
### 6. With Clause

calculate the total fare paid by each user:
```javascript
WITH TotalFarePerUser AS (
    SELECT Booked_by_user, SUM(Amount) AS total_fare
    FROM Ticket t
    JOIN Payment p ON t.PNR_No = p.PNR_No
    GROUP BY Booked_by_user
)
SELECT u.Username, u.F_Name, u.L_Name, tfp.total_fare
FROM Users u
LEFT JOIN TotalFarePerUser tfp ON u.Username = tfp.Booked_by_user;
```
### 7. Scalar Subquery

```javascript
SELECT Username, 
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Ticket WHERE Booked_by_user = Users.Username) AS num_tickets
FROM Users;
```
- Special Cases: Scalar without a from clause
  ```javascript
  SELECT 5 * 5 AS square;
  ```

## Task 9: Window Functions

Window functions are a powerful feature in SQL that allow you to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row.
These functions operate on a "window" of rows defined by a partition or an entire result set. 
They can be used to calculate aggregates, rankings, and perform other analytical tasks without the need for subqueries or self-joins.

Syntax

```javascript
function_name(arg1, arg2, ...) OVER (
    [PARTITION BY partition_expression]
    [ORDER BY order_expression [ASC | DESC]]
    [ROWS/RANGE frame_specification]
)
```

Calculate the total fare for each flight and display it alongside other flight 

```javascript
SELECT 
    Flight_no, Dep_time, Destination, 
    SUM(Fare) OVER (PARTITION BY Flight_no) AS total_fare
FROM 
    Flight
JOIN 
    Class USING (Flight_no);

```

Rank users by the number of tickets they've booked:

```javascript
SELECT 
    passenger_name, 
    COUNT(*) AS num_tickets_booked,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS booking_rank
FROM 
    Ticket
GROUP BY 
    passenger_name;
```
Calculate the running total distance traveled for each user:
```javascript
SELECT 
    Username, Flight_no, Dep_time, Destination, Distance,
    SUM(Distance) OVER (PARTITION BY Username ORDER BY Dep_time) AS running_distance
FROM 
    Flight;
```
