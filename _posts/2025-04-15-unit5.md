## Normal Forms


- ### First Normal Form
  - Rules:
    - Table should contain atomic values(values can no longer be decomposed)
    - Table values stored in a column should be of the same domain.
    - All columns should have unique names.
    - The order in which data is stored in the table should not matter.

Example
Suppose we have a Product table that stores information about products and their associated categories. The table might look like this:

| product_id | product_name | product_price | categories           |
|------------|--------------|---------------|----------------------|
| 1          | Product A    | 19.99         | Electronics, Gadgets |
| 2          | Product B    | 29.99         | Clothing, Fashion    |
| 3          | Product C    | 14.99         | Books, Literature    |

In this table, we can see that the categories column violates the First Normal Form because it contains multiple values (comma-separated) in a single column. According to the First Normal Form, each column should contain atomic (single) values.

To fix this violation, we can follow a similar approach as mentioned in the previous example:

1. Create a separate table for categories: We can create a new table called Categories to store the categories separately. This table will have a one-to-many relationship with the Product table, where one product can have multiple categories. The Product table will look like this:

| product_id | product_name | product_price |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| 1          | Product A    | 19.99         |
| 2          | Product B    | 29.99         |
| 3          | Product C    | 14.99         |
|            |              |               |


And the Categories table will look like this:

| category_id | category_name | product_id |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| 1           | Electronics   | 1          |
| 2           | Gadgets       | 1          |
| 3           | Clothing      | 2          |
| 4           | Fashion       | 2          |

In this approach, the Categories table has a one-to-many relationship with the Product table, where each product can have multiple categories, and each category is stored as a separate row.

2. Add multiple rows for each product-category combination: Another approach is to add multiple rows in the Product table, where each row represents a product-category combination. The Product table will look like this:

| product_id | product_name | product_price | category    |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|-------------|
| 1         | Product A    | 19.99         | Electronics |
| 1         | Product A    | 19.99         | Gadgets     |
| 2         | Product B    | 29.99         | Clothing    |
| 2         | Product B    | 29.99         | Fashion     |

In this approach, each row represents a unique combination of product and category, eliminating the need for a separate Categories table. However, this approach can lead to data redundancy and potential inconsistencies if the product information needs to be updated.

Both approaches address the violation of the First Normal Form by separating the multiple values into separate rows or tables. The choice between the two approaches depends on the specific requirements and considerations of the database design, such as data integrity, performance, and potential future changes.

- ### Second Normal Form
  - Rules:
    - The table should be in first normal form.
    - There should be no partial dependencies in the table.
      - Partial dependency: When a table has a composite primary key, which consists of two or more columns. All the other columns (not part of the primary key) in that table should depend on the entire composite primary key, not just a part of it. If any non-primary key column depends on only a part of the composite primary key, it is called a partial dependency.

Example

Suppose we have a database for a library management system with the following tables:

Book Table:

| book_id | book_title | author   | publisher_name | publisher_address |
|---------|------------|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1       | Book A     | Author X | Publisher 1    | Address 1         |
| 2       | Book B     | Author Y | Publisher 2    | Address 2         |
| 3       | Book C     | Author Z | Publisher 1    | Address 1         |


BorrowedBooks Table:

| borrow_id | member_id | book_id | borrowed_date | due_date   | publisher_name |
|-----------|-----------|---------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| 1         | 101       | 1       | 2023-03-01    | 2023-03-15 | Publisher 1    |
| 2         | 102       | 2       | 2023-03-05    | 2023-03-19 | Publisher 2    |
| 3         | 103       | 3       | 2023-03-10    | 2023-03-24 | Publisher 1    |

In the above design, the BorrowedBooks table violates the Second Normal Form because the publisher_name column is dependent on the book_id column, which is only a part of the candidate key (borrow_id). This partial dependency can lead to data redundancy and potential inconsistencies.

To apply the Second Normal Form, we need to remove the publisher_name column from the BorrowedBooks table and move it to the Book table since it depends on the book_id column.

Here's how the tables should look after applying the Second Normal Form:

Book Table:

| book_id | book_title | author   | publisher_id | publisher_name | publisher_address |
|--------|------------|----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1      | Book A     | Author X | 1            | Publisher 1    | Address 1         |
| 2      | Book B     | Author Y | 2            | Publisher 2    | Address 2         |
| 3      | Book C     | Author Z | 1            | Publisher 1    | Address 1         |

BorrowedBooks Table:

| borrow_id | member_id | book_id | borrowed_date | due_date   |
|-----------|-----------|---------|---------------|------------|
| 1         | 101       | 1       | 2023-03-01    | 2023-03-15 |
| 2         | 102       | 2       | 2023-03-05    | 2023-03-19 |
| 3         | 103       | 3       | 2023-03-10    | 2023-03-24 |

In the updated design, we have created a new column publisher_id in the Book table to establish a relationship with the publisher information. The publisher_name and publisher_address columns are now part of the Book table, as they depend on the publisher_id column.

By separating the publisher information into the Book table, we have eliminated the partial dependency in the BorrowedBooks table. Now, all non-key columns in the BorrowedBooks table depend on the entire candidate key (borrow_id), satisfying the Second Normal Form.

This normalization process helps to reduce data redundancy, maintain data integrity, and facilitate easier data manipulation and querying within the database.



- ### Third Normal Form
  - Rules:
    - The table should satisfy second normal form.
    - The table should not contain transitive dependency.
      - Transitive dependency: In a table, when the primary key columns uniquely identify each row. Other non-key columns should depend on the entire primary key for their values. However, if a non-key column depends on another non-key column (and not the primary key), it creates a transitive dependency. 

Example

Suppose we have a database for a car rental system with the following tables:

Car Table:

| car_id | make   | model   | year |
|--------|--------|---------|------|
| 1      | Toyota | Camry   | 2020 |
| 2      | Honda  | Civic   | 2019 |
| 3      | Ford   | Mustang | 2021 |

Rental Table:

| rental_id | car_id | customer_id | rental_date | return_date | rental_type | daily_rate |
|----------|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| 1        | 1      | 101         | 2023-03-01  | 2023-03-05  | Standard    | 50         |
| 2        | 2      | 102         | 2023-03-10  | 2023-03-15  | Premium     | 75         |
| 3        | 3      | 103         | 2023-03-20  | 2023-03-25  | Standard    | 50         |

In the above design, the Rental table violates the Third Normal Form because the daily_rate column is transitively dependent on the rental_type column, which is a non-prime attribute (not part of the candidate key).

Transitive Dependency: The daily_rate depends on the rental_type column, which is not a part of the candidate key (rental_id). This transitive dependency can lead to data redundancy and potential data inconsistencies.

To remove the transitive dependency and bring the Rental table into the Third Normal Form, we need to create a separate table for rental_type and daily_rate.

Here's how the tables should look after applying the Third Normal Form:

Car Table: No change

| car_id | make   | model   | year |
|--------|--------|---------|------|
| 1      | Toyota | Camry   | 2020 |
| 2      | Honda  | Civic   | 2019 |
| 3      | Ford   | Mustang | 2021 |

Rental Table: Updated to remove transitive dependency

| rental_id | car_id | customer_id | rental_date | return_date | rental_type_id |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1         | 1      | 101         | 2023-03-01  | 2023-03-05  | 1              |
| 2         | 2      | 102         | 2023-03-10  | 2023-03-15  | 2              |
| 3         | 3      | 103         | 2023-03-20  | 2023-03-25  | 1              |

RentalType Table: New table to store rental type information

| rental_type_id | rental_type | daily_rate |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| 1              | Standard    | 50         |
| 2              | Premium     | 75         |

In the updated design, we have created a new RentalType table to store the rental_type and daily_rate information. The Rental table now has a rental_type_id column that references the RentalType table, eliminating the transitive dependency.

By separating the rental_type and daily_rate into the RentalType table, we have removed the transitive dependency in the Rental table. All non-key columns in the Rental table now depend solely on the candidate key (rental_id), satisfying the Third Normal Form.

This normalization process helps to reduce data redundancy, maintain data integrity, and facilitate easier data manipulation and querying within the database.


- ### Boyce-Codd Normal Form
  - Rules:
    - The table should satisfy third normal form.
    - For each functional dependency X->Y in the table, X should be a Super Key.

Example

Suppose we have a database for a library management system with the following table:

BookLending Table:


| lending_id | member_id | book_id | borrower_name | author           | genre   |
|------------|-----------|---------|---------------|------------------|---------|
| 1          | 101       | 1       | John Doe      | J.K. Rowling     | Fantasy |
| 2          | 102       | 2       | Jane Smith    | Ernest Hemingway | Fiction |

In the above table:

The primary key is lending_id.
The borrower_name column depends on the member_id column.
The author and genre columns depend on the book_id column.

This table satisfies the First Normal Form (1NF) because all values are atomic, column names are unique, and all values in a column are of the same domain.

It also satisfies the Second Normal Form (2NF) because there is no partial dependency (all non-key columns depend on the entire primary key).

Additionally, it satisfies the Third Normal Form (3NF) because there is no transitive dependency (all non-key columns depend directly on the primary key).

However, this table violates the Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) due to the following reasons:
- The borrower_name column is non-prime (not part of the primary key), but it determines the member_id column, which is part of the candidate key.
- The author and genre columns are non-prime, but they determine the book_id column, which is part of the candidate key.

In BCNF, every determinant (column that determines another column) must be a candidate key. In this case, borrower_name, author, and genre are determinants for member_id and book_id, respectively, but they are not part of the candidate key, violating BCNF.

To satisfy BCNF, we need to decompose the table into three tables:

BookLending Table:

| lending_id | member_id | book_id |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| 1          | 101       | 1       |
| 2          | 102       | 2       |

Member Table:

| member_id | borrower_name |
|-----------|---------------|
| 101       | John Doe      |
| 102       | Jane Smith    |

Book Table:

| book_id | author           | genre   |
|---------|------------------|---------|
| 1       | J.K. Rowling     | Fantasy |
| 2       | Ernest Hemingway | Fiction |

In the updated design, the BookLending table contains the lending_id, member_id, and book_id columns. The Member table contains the member_id and borrower_name columns, while the Book table contains the book_id, author, and genre columns.

By separating the borrower_name, author, and genre columns into their respective tables, we have eliminated the violation of BCNF. Now, within each table, the determinant columns are part of the candidate keys.

This normalization process ensures that the database schema complies with BCNF, reducing data redundancy, maintaining data integrity, and facilitating easier data manipulation and querying.

- ### Fourth Normal Form
  - Rules:
    - The table should be in BCNF.
    - There should be no multi-valued dependency in the table.

Multi-valued Dependency:
A table has a multi-valued dependency when,
- for a single value in one column (A), there are multiple associated values in another column (B).
- the table has at least three columns.
- if there is a multi-valued dependency between columns A and B, then B and the other columns (C) must be independent of each other.

Example

Enrollment Table

| s_id | course  | hobby   |
|------|---------|---------|
| 1    | Science | Cricket |
| 1    | Maths   | Hockey  |

In the above table, we can observe the following:

A student can enroll in multiple courses, and each student can have multiple hobbies.
There is a multi-valued dependency between s_id and course, as well as between s_id and hobby.
The columns course and hobby are independent of each other.

This table violates the Fourth Normal Form (4NF) because it contains multi-valued dependencies. In 4NF, a table should not have multi-valued dependencies, which occur when a single column value in a row corresponds to multiple values in another column.

To satisfy 4NF, we need to decompose the table into two separate tables:

CourseOpted Table

| s_id | course  |
|------|---------|
| 1    | Science |
| 1    | Maths   |

Hobbies Table

| s_id | hobby   |
|------|---------|
| 1    | Cricket |
| 1    | Hockey  |

In the updated design, the CourseOpted table stores the relationship between s_id and course, while the Hobbies table stores the relationship between s_id and hobby.

By separating the multi-valued dependencies into separate tables, we have eliminated the violation of 4NF. Now, each table represents a single-valued fact about the entity.

This normalization process ensures that the database schema complies with 4NF, reducing data redundancy, maintaining data integrity, and facilitating easier data manipulation and querying.

It's important to note that while 4NF addresses multi-valued dependencies, it does not address other types of dependencies, such as join dependencies or fifth normal form (5NF) violations. Depending on the complexity of the database schema, further normalization steps may be required to achieve higher normal forms.


- ### Fifth Normal Form
  - Rules:
    - Also called Project-Join Normal Form.
    - Fixes join dependency and reduces data redundancy,
    - Also fixes update anomalies in DB design.

Join Dependency:

When two attributes in a database table are independent of each other but still get combined together in the same row, it is known as a join dependency. This situation can lead to redundant data and potential inconsistencies. For instance, if a table has columns for student name, course name, and instructor name, and a student can take multiple courses with different instructors, then there exists a join dependency between the course and instructor attributes.

Update Anomalies:

Update anomalies are problems that can occur when attempting to update data in a database table that has not been properly normalized. There are three main types of update anomalies:

Insertion Anomaly: When inserting a new row, the database may require providing certain data that does not exist yet, leading to partial or incomplete data being stored.
  - Deletion Anomaly: When deleting a row, the database might unintentionally lose other data that is not related to the deletion criteria.
  - Modification Anomaly: When updating a value in a row, the database might need to update the same value in multiple rows, leading to potential inconsistencies if not done correctly.
These update anomalies can result in data inconsistencies, redundancies, and potential data loss within the database. Proper database normalization helps eliminate these anomalies by breaking down the data into multiple tables and establishing relationships between them, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
Example:

## BNCF VS 3NF

BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form):

Advantages:
Ensures that every non-trivial functional dependency is a superkey.
Guarantees losslessness.
Dependency preservation is achieved.
Disadvantages:
May lead to redundancy in data storage.
Difficulties in maintaining materialized views due to space and time overhead.
SQL lacks direct support for specifying functional dependencies, making it challenging to enforce.
3NF (Third Normal Form):

Advantages:
Allows for a more relaxed normalization process compared to BCNF.
Avoids or minimizes data redundancy through normalization.
Generally easier to understand and implement.
Disadvantages:
May require the use of null values to represent some relationships, leading to potential loss of information.
Dependency preservation might not always be possible.
SQL lacks direct support for specifying functional dependencies, making it challenging to enforce arbitrary dependencies.
Comparison:

BCNF vs. 3NF:
BCNF ensures stricter normalization and guarantees better preservation of dependencies.
3NF is more flexible and may result in less redundancy but could lead to loss of information and may not preserve all dependencies.
The choice between BCNF and 3NF depends on the specific requirements of the database design and the trade-offs between normalization, redundancy, and dependency preservation.
In scenarios where it's not possible to achieve all goals (BCNF, losslessness, dependency preservation), the decision might come down to prioritizing BCNF over dependency preservation with 3NF, especially considering the limitations of SQL in enforcing functional dependencies beyond primary key constraints.


## Functional Dependency

### Finding closure of a functional dependency

OrderID | CustomerID | CustomerName | PhoneNumber | PizzaType
101 | C001 | Alice | 555-1234 | Margherita
102 | C002 | Bob | 555-5678 | Pepperoni
103 | C001 | Alice | 555-1234 | Veggie

From the table, we can infer some functional dependencies:

CustomerID → CustomerName

CustomerID → PhoneNumber

OrderID → CustomerID

OrderID → PizzaType

```javascript
F = { 
  CustomerID → CustomerName,
  CustomerID → PhoneNumber,
  OrderID → CustomerID,
  OrderID → PizzaType
}
```

Closure of orderID: OrderID⁺ = { OrderID }

Apply FDs:

OrderID → CustomerID

Add CustomerID:

OrderID⁺ = { OrderID, CustomerID }

Now that we have CustomerID:

CustomerID → CustomerName

Add CustomerName

CustomerID → PhoneNumber

Add PhoneNumber

OrderID⁺ = { OrderID, CustomerID, CustomerName, PhoneNumber }

OrderID → PizzaType

Add PizzaType

OrderID⁺ = { OrderID, CustomerID, CustomerName, PhoneNumber, PizzaType }

Final Closure

OrderID⁺ = { OrderID, CustomerID, CustomerName, PhoneNumber, PizzaType }
