## Introduction
As a part of the module requirements, all students must create a personal learning blog website to document what they have learned from a unit.
## Journals
Students are expected to compose reflective blog entries detailing what they have learned from the unit within 7 days of completing the unit in class.

The evaluation criteria include the quality of content and language proficiency.

For this module, students are tasked with completing 6 journal entries corresponding to 6 Units of the module. 

This component contributes 10% towards the overall grade.

## What you are expected to write in your blogs

1. Key takeways from the unit
2. What you learned and why it matters
3. Personal Growth and Reflection

### Note: Please not that the above are not section headings for your blog, they are just content that need to be included in your blog discussions.

## Recommended Blog Site Template
While students have the flexibility to choose any blog site, we recommend utilizing the following blog starter repository for ease of setup:

### Chirpy Blog Starter Repository
- Access the template repository [Chirpy-starter](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter).
- Follow these steps to set up your blog:

1. Navigate to the template repository.

2. Use the template and create a new repository.

3. Name the repository as 'yourgithubusername.github.io'.

### Adding posts to your website

#### Add a file with file name YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.md under _posts folder

Your file should have the .md extension for you to use markdown.

In your case the date should be the date of your flipped class.

Title should be the your  module class and flipped class title, Example; DBS101_FlippedClass1

##### Example file name: 2024-02-12-DBS101_FlippedClass1.md

### Tips!

- #### Change your profile name to your name! It should not show up as chirpy

- #### Use correct file naming conventions, your post should not say MyfirstPost like my demo, it should be your modulecode_FlippedClass{no.}

- #### Try customizing your website, read the instructions on chirpy website:
[chirpy website guide](https://chirpy.cotes.page/)

- #### Do not forget to push your changes on github else it will not be reflected on your website

### Journal Format

- #### Your journal should be in blog format; should follow a structure whereby you have a blog topic and paragraphs detailing what you did during your flipped class and what you have learned.
- #### You can refer videos on writing a blog.



### Add website link to VLE

After deploying the website, add the website link to the database setup for the module on VLE.

Add your website link as an entry to the database on VLE.
