# Guided Session
## Example Database System : Electronic Health System

## Database Catalog

A database catalog is the central repository of metadata, where details about database objects like tables, indexes, and columns are stored.

Example: The EHR Database Patient table

- EHRDB is the Datbase/Catalog
- Public is the schema
- Patient is the table

Three part naming system to identify a relation:

    catalog.schema.table
Eg    EHRDB.public.patient

Check current database:
```javascript
select current_database();
```

Check current schema:
```javascript
select current_schema;
```

## Task 1: Index Definition in SQL

- Create an index

```javascript
CREATE INDEX idx_PatientID ON Patient (PatientID);
```
- Perform a query that can use the index

```javascript 
SELECT *
FROM Patient
WHERE PatientID = 1;
```
- Delete an index

```javascript
drop index idx_PatientID;
```

### Task 2: Granting Privileges

- CREATE USER (inside postgres shell)
```javascript
CREATE USER user1 WITH PASSWORD '12345';
```
Login as user
```javascript
psql -U user1 -d ehrdb
```
- GRANT SELECT PRIVILEGE(to be granted inside ehrdb by root user)
```javascript
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE Patient TO user1;
```
- GRANT UPDATE PRIVILEGE (to be granted inside ehrdb by root user)
```javascript
GRANT UPDATE ON TABLE Appointment TO user1;
```
- GRANT INSERT PRIVILEGE (to be granted inside ehrdb by root user)
```javascript
GRANT INSERT ON TABLE Prescription TO user1;
```
- GRANT DELETE PRIVILEGE (to be granted inside ehrdb by root user)
```javascript
GRANT DELETE ON MedicalHistory TO user1;
```
- GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES (to be granted inside ehrdb shell by root user)
```javascript
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE Diagnosis TO user1;
```
- REVOKE AUTHORISATION/PRIVILEGE (to be revoked inside ehrdb shell by root user)
```javascript
REVOKE INSERT ON MedicalBill FROM user1;
```
- GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON THE DATABASE (to be granted inside postgres shell by root user)
```javascript
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE ehrdb TO user1;
```
## Task 3: Creating Roles

- CREATING ROLE (to be granted inside ehrdb shell by root user)
```javascript
CREATE ROLE doctor_role;
```
- GRANTING PRIVILEGES TO ROLES (to be granted inside ehrdb shell by root user)
```javascript
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE Appointment TO doctor_role;
```
- ACESSING DB THROUGH ROLES (to be granted inside ehrdb shell by root user)
```javascript
GRANT doctor_role TO user1;
```

## Task 4: Authorisation on View

Note: If you already have DoctorAppointmentsView in your database skip the following task and move on to granting privilege to view.
```javascript
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW DoctorAppointmentsView AS
SELECT 
    P.PatientID,
    P.Name AS PatientName,
    P.DateOfBirth,
    P.Gender,
    P.Address,
    P.ContactNumber,
    P.Email,
    P.BloodType,
    P.Allergies,
    P.OtherMedicalInfo,
    A.AppointmentID,
    A.DoctorID,
    A.AppointmentDate,
    A.AppointmentTime,
    A.Purpose,
    D.Name AS DoctorName, -- Include doctor's name
    D.Specialization -- Include doctor's specialization
FROM 
    Patient P
LEFT JOIN 
    Appointment A ON P.PatientID = A.PatientID
LEFT JOIN 
    Doctor D ON A.DoctorID = D.DoctorID;
```
```javascript (to be granted inside ehrdb shell by root user)
GRANT SELECT ON DoctorAppointmentsView TO user1;
```
## Task 5: Authorisation on Schemas

- References privilege that permits a user to declare foreign keys when creating relations. (to be granted inside postgres shell by root user)
```javascript
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA EHRDB TO user1;
```
## Task 6: Transfer of privileges (to be granted inside ehrdb shell by root user)
```javascript
GRANT SELECT ON patient TO user1 WITH GRANT OPTION;
```
## Task 7: Revoking of privileges (to be revoked inside ehrdb shell by root user)
```javascript
REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE Patient FROM user1;
```
```javascript
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA EHRDB FROM user1;
```
## Task 8: Row level Authorisation

In PostgreSQL, row-level authorization can be implemented using a feature called Row-Level Security (RLS). RLS allows you to control which rows a user can access from a table based on specified security policies. Here's an example of how you can implement row-level authorization using RLS in PostgreSQL:

Example: viewing of medical history of a patient to be permitted by only the doctor with whom the patient has appointment.

(to be granted inside ehrdb shell by user1)

```javascript
CREATE ROLE appointment_viewer;
```

```javascript
GRANT SELECT ON Appointment TO appointment_viewer;
```

```javascript
CREATE POLICY appointment_viewer_policy
    ON MedicalHistory
    USING (EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM Appointment AS A
        WHERE A.PatientID = MedicalHistory.PatientID
        AND A.DoctorID = 1                
    ));
```

```javascript
GRANT appointment_viewer TO test_user;
```

# [OPTIONAL TASK]: Accessing SQL from a programming language Using Python

Note: A cursor is a mechanism that points to one or more rows in a set of rows. The rows are retrieved from a table or in a result set that is returned by a stored procedure. Your application program can use a cursor to retrieve rows from a table.


1. Install psycopg2 package 

```javascript
pip install psycopg2
```
2. Create User and Grant Privileges to User

```javascript
CREATE USER user2 WITH PASSWORD '12345';
```

3.  Connect to PostgreSQL DB from python

- Create a  file called database.ini to store database connection parameters:


database.ini: Adding the following lines of code to the file

```javascript
[postgresql]
host=localhost
database=ehrdb
user= user1
password='12345'
```

- Create a configuration file: config.py and add the following lines of code to the file:

```javascript
from configparser import ConfigParser

def load_config(filename='database.ini', section='postgresql'):
    parser = ConfigParser()
    parser.read(filename)

    # get section, default to postgresql
    config = {}
    if parser.has_section(section):
        params = parser.items(section)
        for param in params:
            config[param[0]] = param[1]
    else:
        raise Exception('Section {0} not found in the {1} file'.format(section, filename))

    return config

if __name__ == '__main__':
    config = load_config()
    print(config)
```

1. Create a file: connect.py and add the following lines of code

```javascript
import psycopg2
from config import load_config

def connect(config):
    """ Connect to the PostgreSQL database server """
    try:
        # connecting to the PostgreSQL server
        with psycopg2.connect(**config) as conn:
            print('Connected to the PostgreSQL server.')
            return conn
    except (psycopg2.DatabaseError, Exception) as error:
        print(error)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    config = load_config()
    connect(config)
```

Run the file

```javascript
python connect.py
```

Output should be: 
```javascript
Connected to the PostgreSQL server. 
```
If connection is successful.

5. Sending SQL query and Displaying Output on webpage

- Install flask
```javascript
pip install flask
```
- Create a folder called templates inside your project
- Inside templates create index.html file and add the following code:

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Patients</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Patients</h1>
    <form action="/search" method="post">
        <input type="text" name="search_query" placeholder="Search by patient name">
        <button type="submit">Search</button>
    </form>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Age</th>
            <th>Gender</th>
            <!-- Add more columns if needed -->
        </tr>
        {% for patient in patients %}
        <tr>
            <td>{{ patient[1] }}</td>
            <td>{{ patient[2] }}</td>
            <td>{{ patient[3] }}</td>
            <!-- Display more patient details as needed -->
        </tr>
        {% endfor %}
    </table>
</body>
</html>
```

- Inside the project directory create another file, name it app.py, add the following lines of code:

```javascript
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
import psycopg2
from config import load_config

app = Flask(__name__)

def get_patients():
    config = load_config()
    try:
        with psycopg2.connect(**config) as conn:
            with conn.cursor() as cur:
                cur.execute("SELECT * FROM patient;")
                return cur.fetchall()
            
    except (Exception, psycopg2.DatabaseError) as error:
        print(error)
        return []

@app.route('/')
def index():
    patients = get_patients()
    return render_template('index.html', patients=patients)

@app.route('/search', methods=['POST'])
def search():
    search_query = request.form.get('search_query')
    config = load_config()
    try:
        with psycopg2.connect(**config) as conn:
            with conn.cursor() as cur:
                cur.execute("SELECT * FROM patient WHERE name ILIKE %s;", ('%' + search_query + '%',))
                patients = cur.fetchall()
        return render_template('index.html', patients=patients)
    except (Exception, psycopg2.DatabaseError) as error:
        print(error)
        return render_template('index.html', patients=[])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
